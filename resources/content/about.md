<div class="max-w-lg">
Hey there! I'm <strong>&commat;brysonreece</strong>, a passionate <a href="/work#community">maker</a>, <a href="/work#professional">full-stack engineer</a>, and <a href="/posts">avid learner</a>.
<br>
<br>

I spend most of my days creating new combinations of hardware and software. I try and share what I've learned through various <a href="/posts">posts</a>, <a href="/talks">talks</a>, <a href="/talks">workshops</a>, <a href="/posts">articles</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/brysonio" target="_blank">tweets</a>. (Still working on that last one!)
<br>
<br>

I'm extremely proud of a select few projects I've had to honor to work with others on:

<br>
<br>

<ul class="ml-4 mb-2">
    <li>
        <strong>2019:</strong> Built out a number of internal tooling solutions for WellCaddie.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2">
        <strong>2018:</strong> Created <a href="https://github.com/athena-app" target="_blank">Athena</a> with <a href="https://ryandobyns.com" target="_blank">Ryan Dobyns</a>, a VR learning management system built for distributed education.
    </li>
    <li class="mt-2">
        <strong>2017:</strong> Worked with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Stalling" target="_blank">Jonathan Stalling</a> on patented new forms of Chinese pronunciation techniques. I also co-founded <a href="http://www.oudaily.com/news/new-ou-virtual-reality-club-collaborates-with-university-libraries-to/article_2119815e-11a0-11e7-9366-5f15030681c5.html" target="_blank">OUVR</a>.
    <li class="mt-2">
        <strong>2016: </strong>Helped create and develop O.V.A.L., which went on to host the <a href="https://campustechnology.com/articles/2017/10/09/multi-campus-vr-session-tours-remote-cave-art.aspx" target="_blank">world's first</a> multi-state, multi-campus virtual reality classroom session.
    </li>
</ul>
